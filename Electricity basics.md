# Electricity basics

[TOC]


## Introduction

- physial phenomena of electrical charges
- often used as synonym for current, e.g. "create electricity"



## Charge

- fundamental property of subatomic particles, like mass, length, etc.
- responsible for electric force, similar to how mass is responsible for gravitational force
- two kinds of charges, positive and negative, unlike mass where there is only one kind of mass
- protons are positively charged, electrons are negatively charged
- electrons and protons have same magnitute of charge, called elementary charge, smallest amount of charge
- like charges repel each other, opposite charges attract each other, unlike gravitational force which is always attractive
- unit: Coulomb `C`



## Current

- rate of flow of charge past a point, amount of charge that flows by per unit time
- unit: Ampere `C/s`
- often uses as synonym for charge, e.g. "current is flowing"
- technischen Stromrichtung: direction that positive charges would flow, independent of what the actual charge carriers are, i.e. `+` to `-` in circuit
- physikalische Stromrichtung: direction that charge carriers flow, dependent of what actual charge carriers are, i.e. if electrons then `-` to `+` in circuit



## Voltage (between two points)

- difference in potential between the two points, work needed per unit of charge to move a test charge between the two points
- choice of reference point is irrelevant since taking the difference cancels it out
- unit: Volt `J/C`
- negative charge is pulled towards higher voltages, positive charge is pulled towards lower voltages, i.e. in technische Stromrichtung current flows from higher voltage to lower voltage



## Circuit

- a closed path around which a current can flow
- needs a voltage, otherwise no current is flowing



## Water analogy

- charge: water element
- current: water flow rate, e.g. 1l of water flows by in this tube per second
- voltage: water pressure, pushes water in one direction, makes water do work, e.g. spin a turbine
- charge is what flows, voltage is what makes it flow, current is how fast it flows
- current is inherent property of circuit, not of external charges, can not have current if circuit is not closed
- voltage is not inherent property of circuit, created using external energy source, can have voltage if circuit is not closed
